    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>A Tontine:</strong> is a crowdfunding and saving practice that is
        popular in  Asia and Africa. It is made up of several family and/or
        community related members, in which each member contributes a fixed amount
        of money to a pool of funds, at predetermined intervals, and where the
        collected sum in the pool is then transferred to one members of the group on
        a rotating basis. This cycle is continued until each participating member
        has had a turn in receiving the sum in the pool of funds.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong></strong> <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
        In the App, you will be able to set up or to participate in a tontine either
        as Tontine Manager or as Participant.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong></strong> <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Tontine Manager:</strong>you will be considered a Tontine Manager
        where you create a tontine group, determine the number of participants, the
        sum to be contributed, the intervals in which they must be made, the
        recipient of the total sum and/or any other reasonable condition which you
        may impose. For avoidance of doubt, a Tontine Manager is also a Participant.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Participant:</strong>you will be considered a Participant where you
        join a tontine group created by a Tontine Manager and you agree to the
        conditions of the tontine group.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong></strong> <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
        We offer the following different tontine services:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong></strong> <br/>
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Standard Campaign:</strong>this will enable you to create or to
            join in a tontine group in which each participant contributes any
            desired amount with the aim to reach a target amount. Once the target
            amount is met, the money pot will be closed, and the Tontine Manager
            decides how the money is utilised.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        <strong></strong> <br/>
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Carousel Campaign:</strong> you will create or join a tontine
            group in which all participants contribute the same pre-determined
            amount at pre-determined intervals. At end of each interval, one
            participant receives the total amount collected. This cycle continues
            until each participant has taken a turn in being a beneficiary.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        <strong></strong> <br/>
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Solidarity Campaign:</strong>you will create or join a tontine
            group in which the participants contribute a pre-determined sum, for a
            pre-determined period, and the accumulated amount is then transferred to
            a specific beneficiary.<strong></strong>The initial cycle has a
            predetermined duration (e.g., 6 months), and the renewal of the cycle
            requires approval from all participants.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Project Campaign:</strong> This option establishes a money pot
            that collects contributions from the participants in defined cycles
            (weekly, monthly) and transfers the accumulated amount to a specified
            beneficiary in each cycle, as the “Carrousel Campaign”. The difference
            in this case is that the objective of the campaign requires the
            collections to be made for a few cycles in order to reach a specific
            amount before the total amount is transferred to the first beneficiary.
        </li>

        As the App facilitates payment services, security is of paramount
        importance. You must keep your device secure and properly close the App
        after each use. You must ensure that any security details, payment

        Subject to these Terms &amp; Conditions you will be able to use our Services
        by logging into your account via the App and within your Smile Account
        giving us your Transfer or Payment instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Payment instructions must include such information as we determine from time
        to time for the order to be executed by us, including (without limitation)
        the following information:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            name and other details (e.g., in some cases address, date of birth)
            identifying the Recipient;
        </li>
        <li>
            destination country of the Payment Transaction;
        </li>
        <li>
            amount and currency of the Payment Transaction;
        </li>
        <li>
            in case of a Payment Transaction to a Recipient’s bank account, the IBAN
            code (International Bank Account Number) when such bank account has an
            IBAN code, or the bank account code as corresponds in each case.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Once you enter the above information, you will be required to authenticate
        the Payment instructions by means required by us.
    </p>
    <p>
        We will only accept a Payment instruction which is made through the App.
        Your Payment instructions will be treated by us as your consent for us to
        proceed with, and our authorisation to perform, that Payment Transaction.
    </p>
    <p>
        We do not provide credit and are not able to advance any funds to cover any
        part of your Payment instructions.

        <li>
            <strong>CURRENCY EXCHANGE</strong>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        For Payment instructions in favour of a Recipient in a currency other than
        euro (EUR) we will check whether we can service the requested currency and,
        if yes, then we will apply the retail exchange rate at the time that the
        payment instruction is executed, in addition to any service charges
        applicable. The retail exchange rate for such currency exchange is acquired
        by us at a wholesale rate that fluctuates. The difference between the retail
        exchange rate applied to such Payment instructions and the wholesale
        exchange rate at which we acquired the pay-out currency will be kept by us,
        in addition to any service charges.

            <strong>PAYMENT TRANSACTON EXECUTION</strong>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Once a Payment instruction is received by us, it shall be irrevocable
        (except to the extent that it may be withdrawn by you as set out in clause
        22). A Payment instruction is deemed to be received at the point in time
        that we record in our systems that it has been actually received, subject to
        the following exceptions:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            if the Payment instruction is recorded as received on a non-Business
            Day. In this case it will be considered as received on the first
            following Business Day;
        </li>
        <li>
            if the Payment instruction is recorded as received on a Business Day,
            but not during business hours, which are 8am – 5 pm. In this case, it
            will be considered as received on the first following Business Day.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Where a Payment instruction is executed based on incorrect details provided
        by you (e.g., incorrect IBAN for the Recipient’s bank account), the Payment
        instruction will be deemed executed properly and we shall not be liable for
        any losses incurred.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once a Payment instruction has been received and executed by us in
        accordance with the App’s Terms &amp; Conditions, we shall provide you with
        the following information, without any undue delay, via the App:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            a reference number enabling you to identify the Payment Transaction and
            the Recipient;
        </li>
        <li>
            the amount of the Payment Transaction stated in the currency used in the
            Payment instructions;
        </li>
        <li>
            confirmation of any customer fees and/or costs related to the Payment
            Transaction that you must pay to us;
        </li>
        <li>
            if a Payment Transaction involves currency exchange, the exchange rate
            used by us to execute the Payment Transaction and the amount of the
            Payment Transaction after this currency conversion.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        When the Payment Transaction has been confirmed, you will automatically
        receive a notification via the App. Once the Payment Transaction has been
        executed by us you will also receive a notification via the App confirming
        when the funds have been received by the Recipient.

        <li>
            <strong>UNAUTHORISED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS</strong>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        We may be liable to you under applicable laws where we perform a Payment
        Transaction for you that you did not authorise us to perform.
    </p>
    <p>
        Where you believe we may have performed a Payment Transaction you did not
        authorise us to perform, you should let us know immediately via the contact
        details set out at clause 30 below. We will make immediate effort to
        investigate the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
        Subject to the paragraphs below, where we have performed such a Payment
        Transaction and the investigation of the matter shows that in fact a Payment
        Transaction was executed without your authorisation, we will immediately (no
        later than the end of the next Business Day) refund to you in full the
        amount of that Payment Transaction.
    </p>
    <p>
        You will not be entitled to any such refund:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            if you do not inform us by notice in writing without undue delay on you
            becoming aware that an unauthorised Payment Transaction may have
            occurred, and in any event not later than 13 months after the date on
            which the unauthorised Payment Transaction was made; or
        </li>
        <li>
            if the Payment Transaction was authorised by you; or
        </li>
        <li>
            if an unauthorized Payment Transaction was performed due to your fault
            (e.g., you disclosed your user account and authentication details); or
        </li>
        <li>
            if we have a reasonable ground to suspect fraud in such actions and we
            report this to the relevant regulatory authority (in which case, the
            refund is suspended pending of the investigation of the fraud case). You
            will be liable to us for all losses which we suffer or incur relating to
            any fraud or fraudulent activity by you at any time.

    <p>
        We, as Agent of your payment service provider, are responsible for the
        proper execution of Payment Transactions, provided that all Payment
        Transaction details provided by you are correct, properly submitted and
        there is no ground to reject the execution of the Payment instructions.
        Accordingly, we may be liable to you under applicable laws where we fail to
        perform or incorrectly perform any Payment Transaction that you authorised
        us to perform.
    </p>
    <p>
        Where you believe we may have failed to perform or incorrectly performed
        such a Payment Transaction, you should let us know immediately via the
        contact details set out at clause 30 below and, if you request, we will make
        immediate efforts to investigate the matter and let you know the outcome of
        our investigation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Subject to the paragraphs below, where we have failed to perform or
        incorrectly performed such a Payment Transaction, we will without undue
        delay make good and correct the error and deliver the amount of the
        unperformed or incorrectly performed Payment Transaction as originally
        instructed. You will not be charged for such corrected Payment Transaction.
    </p>
    <p>
        You will not be entitled to the remedy mentioned above:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            if you do not inform us by notice in writing without undue delay (and in
            any event not later than 13 months after the date on which the incorrect
            Payment Transaction was performed) on you becoming aware of our failure
            to perform a Payment Transaction authorised by you or incorrect
            performance by us of a Payment Transaction authorised by you; or
        </li>
        <li>
            where we are able to show that the authorised amount was received at the
            appropriate time by the Recipient; or
        </li>
        <li>
            if the failure to perform or the incorrect performance was due to you
            providing us with incomplete or incorrect information or was otherwise
            due to your fault.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We will have no liability to you for failure to execute, or any incorrect
        execution of, a Payment Transaction where the reason was our refusal to
        proceed with that Payment Transaction or any part of it or if the Payment
        Transaction was incorrectly performed due to your fault (e.g., by providing
        incorrect payment or Recipient data).
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>FEES</strong>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        The use of our Services will incur a customer transaction fee (which will be
        charged by adding the fee to the amount on the Payment instruction) and any
        other costs as provided in these Terms &amp; Conditions. In accordance with
        applicable laws and regulations, and before execution of a Payment
        instruction, we shall provide information to you regarding the fee and any
        applicable exchange rates, which will be displayed in the order preview
        section of the App. If you do not accept the fees or exchange rates applied,
        you shall have a right to revoke the Payment instruction order until such
        time as the Payment instruction is received by the Recipient.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to any fees charged by us, a Payment Transaction may be subject
        to other fees and costs and exchange rates payable to other parties, for
        example, other payment institutions involved in the Payment Transaction, as
        well as deductions that may apply (for example for tax reasons) as required
        by the authorities of the destination country of the Payment Transaction.
        The amount that we deduct will be no more than the amount of our legal
        responsibility.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you use your mobile phone in connection with a Payment Transaction, you
        will also be responsible for any fees that your phone service provider may
        charge, such as fees for SMS, data services, and any other fees that your
        phone service provider may charge.

    <p>
        We will report any suspicious activity to the relevant regulating

        If any Payment Transaction is conducted or attempted to be conducted in

        we reserve the right to reverse the Payment Transaction, and/or close or

            <strong>RIGHT TO RESCIND OR CANCEL A PAYMENT TRANSACTION</strong>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Where you have authorised us to perform a Payment Transaction, we will
        execute that Payment Transaction unless:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            you provide us with clear instructions that you wish to rescind the
            Payment instruction by contacting our customer service team whose
            details are specified in clause 30 below and, in all cases;
        </li>
        <li>
            we agree in writing with you that we will not do so.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        (together a “<strong>Cancellation</strong>”)
    </p>
    <p>
        For the avoidance of doubt, we will not accept any Cancellation if:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            the Payment instruction has already been paid out to your Recipient;
        </li>
        <li>
            your instructions are unclear; or
        </li>
        <li>
            if any Cancellation instruction is received by us after 5.00pm on the
            last Business Day before the day that Payment Transaction is due to take
            place.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Notwithstanding the above, if you provide us with clear Cancellation
        instructions, other than in the circumstances described above where we will
        not accept a Cancellation, we will attempt (to the extent possible at that
        time) to cancel the Payment Transaction prior to the Payment Transaction
        being paid out to the Recipient. We will not, however, be liable for any
        losses incurred in connection with the Cancellation or if the Cancelation
        cannot be performed (e.g., in the event it has been executed and the funds
        have been received by the Recipient) and we reserve the right to charge you
        a fee to cover our reasonable costs for a Cancellation.

        authorises us to perform our Services, cut or failure of power, failure of
        equipment, systems or software or internet interconnectivity or the
        occurrence of any extraordinary fluctuation in any financial market that may
        materially adversely affect our ability to perform our Services. If any of
        these circumstances occur in the course of executing a Payment Transaction,
        then these Terms &amp; Conditions that were applicable at the moment the
