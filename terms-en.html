    <strong><u>DIASPO APP: TERMS AND CONDITIONS</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>1.</strong> <strong>INTRODUCTION</strong>
</p>
<p>
    These Terms and Conditions (the “<strong>T&amp;Cs</strong>”) are offered by:
</p>

    <strong>NBK DIASPO B.V,</strong> a company incorporated in the Netherlands

</p>
<p>
    hereinafter “<strong>MONEYTRANS</strong>’ “<strong>NBK</strong>”, “<strong>Diaspo</strong>”, 
    “<strong>we</strong>”, “<strong>our</strong>” or “<strong>us</strong>”.
</p>
<p>
    DIASPO acts as a Digital Agent for
    <strong>
        MONEYTRANS Payment Services SA
    </strong>
    (“<strong>Moneytrans”</strong>).
</p>
<p>
    MoneyTrans is a payment institution authorised and regulated by the National
    Bank of Belgium (www.nbb.be) to provide money transfer and payment account
    services across the European Union.
</p>
<p>
    MoneyTrans authorises Diaspo to offer through the mobile App
    <strong>
        Diaspo
    </strong>
    (the ”<strong>App</strong>”) money transfer and payment account services
    along with the management of tontine contributions (the “Services”).
</p>
<p>
    THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS APPLY TO AND GOVERN THE USER’S ACCESS TO AND USE
    OF THE APP.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS ARE LEGALLY BINDING AND THEREFORE, IT IS
        IMPORTANT THAT YOU CAREFULLY READ AND UNDERSTAND THESE TERMS AND
        CONDITIONS BEFORE YOU ACCEPT THEM. BY DOWNLOADING THE APP, YOU CONFIRM
        THAT YOU ACCEPT TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS. PLEASE DO NOT
        DOWNLOAD THE APP AND/OR USE ANY OF OUR SERVICES IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH
        THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>2.</strong> <strong>TONTINE DESCRIPTION</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Definitions</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>A Tontine:</strong> is a crowdfunding and saving practice that is
    popular in  Asia and Africa. It is made up of several family and/or
    community related members, in which each member contributes a fixed amount
    of money to a pool of funds, at predetermined intervals, and where the
    collected sum in the pool is then transferred to one members of the group on
    a rotating basis. This cycle is continued until each participating member
    has had a turn in receiving the sum in the pool of funds. <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    In the App, you will be able to set up or to participate in a tontine either
    as Tontine Manager or as Participant.
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Tontine Manager:</strong>you will be considered a Tontine Manager
    where you create a tontine group, determine the number of participants, the
    sum to be contributed, the intervals in which they must be made, the
    recipient of the total sum and/or any other reasonable condition which you
    may impose. For avoidance of doubt, a Tontine Manager is also a Participant.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Participant:</strong>you will be considered a Participant where you
    join a tontine group created by a Tontine Manager and you agree to the
    conditions of the tontine group. <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    We offer the following different tontine services:
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>(i)</strong><strong>Standard Campaign:</strong>this will enable you
    to create or to join in a tontine group in which each participant
    contributes any desired amount with the aim to reach a target amount. Once
    the target amount is met, the money pot will be closed, and the Tontine
    Manager decides how the money is utilised. <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>(ii)</strong> <strong>Carousel Campaign:</strong> you will create or
    join a tontine group in which all participants contribute the same
    pre-determined amount at pre-determined intervals. At end of each interval,
    one participant receives the total amount collected. This cycle continues
    until each participant has taken a turn in being a beneficiary.
    <strong>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    (iii) <strong>Solidarity Campaign:</strong>you will create or join a tontine
    group in which the participants contribute a pre-determined sum, for a
    pre-determined period, and the accumulated amount is then transferred to a
    specific beneficiary.<strong></strong>The initial cycle has a predetermined
    duration (e.g., 6 months), and the renewal of the cycle requires approval
    from all participants.
</p>
<p>
    (iv) <strong>Project Campaign:</strong> This option establishes a money pot
    that collects contributions from the participants in defined cycles (weekly,
    monthly) and transfers the accumulated amount to a specified beneficiary in
    each cycle, as the “Carrousel Campaign”. The difference in this case is that
    the objective of the campaign requires the collections to be made for a few
    cycles in order to reach a specific amount before the total amount is
    transferred to the first beneficiary.
</p>

    provide the reasons for taking such steps unless we are prevented from doing
    so for legal reasons.
    <strong>
        Taking these steps do not make us liable for any loss or damage caused
        as a consequence of your failure to comply with your duties under the
        Terms and Conditions.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    We reserve the right to disable your log-in credentials and/or any other
    security features at our sole discretion for any or no reason, including if,

    For Payment instructions in favour of a Recipient in a currency other than
    euro (EUR) we will check whether we can service the requested currency and,
    if yes, then we will apply the retail exchange rate at the time that the
    payment instruction is executed, in addition to any service charges
    applicable. The retail exchange rate for such currency exchange is acquired
    by us at a wholesale rate that fluctuates. The difference between the retail
    exchange rate applied to such Payment instructions and the wholesale
    exchange rate at which we acquired the pay-out currency will be kept by us,
    in addition to any service charges.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>14.</strong> <strong>PAYMENT TRANSACTON EXECUTION</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Once a Payment instruction is received by us, it shall be irrevocable
    (except to the extent that it may be withdrawn by you as set out in clause
    22). A Payment instruction is deemed to be received at the point in time
    that we record in our systems that it has been actually received, subject to
    the following exceptions:
</p>
<p>
    (i)             if the Payment instruction is recorded as received on a
    non-Business Day. In this case it will be considered as received on the
    first following Business Day;
</p>
<p>
    (ii)            if the Payment instruction is recorded as received on a
    Business Day, but not during business hours, which are 8am – 5 pm. In this
    case, it will be considered as received on the first following Business Day.
</p>
<p>
    Where a Payment instruction is executed based on incorrect details provided
    by you (e.g., incorrect IBAN for the Recipient’s bank account), the Payment
    instruction will be deemed executed properly and we shall not be liable for
    any losses incurred.
</p>
<p>
    Once a Payment instruction has been received and executed by us in
    accordance with the App’s Terms &amp; Conditions, we shall provide you with
    the following information, without any undue delay, via the App:
</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>
        a reference number enabling you to identify the Payment Transaction and
        the Recipient;
    </li>
    <li>
        the amount of the Payment Transaction stated in the currency used in the
        Payment instructions;
    </li>
    <li>
        confirmation of any customer fees and/or costs related to the Payment
        Transaction that you must pay to us;
    </li>
    <li>
        if a Payment Transaction involves currency exchange, the exchange rate
        used by us to execute the Payment Transaction and the amount of the
        Payment Transaction after this currency conversion.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    When the Payment Transaction has been confirmed, you will automatically
    receive a notification via the App. Once the Payment Transaction has been
    executed by us you will also receive a notification via the App confirming
    when the funds have been received by the Recipient.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>15.</strong> <strong>UNAUTHORISED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We may be liable to you under applicable laws where we perform a Payment
    Transaction for you that you did not authorise us to perform.
</p>
<p>
    Where you believe we may have performed a Payment Transaction you did not
    authorise us to perform, you should let us know immediately via the contact
    details set out at clause 30 below. We will make immediate effort to
    investigate the matter.
</p>
<p>
    Subject to the paragraphs below, where we have performed such a Payment
    Transaction and the investigation of the matter shows that in fact a Payment
    Transaction was executed without your authorisation, we will immediately (no
    later than the end of the next Business Day) refund to you in full the
    amount of that Payment Transaction.
</p>
<p>
    You will not be entitled to any such refund:
</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>
        if you do not inform us by notice in writing without undue delay on you
        becoming aware that an unauthorised Payment Transaction may have
        occurred, and in any event not later than 13 months after the date on
        which the unauthorised Payment Transaction was made; or
    </li>
    <li>
        if the Payment Transaction was authorised by you; or
    </li>
    <li>
        if an unauthorized Payment Transaction was performed due to your fault
        (e.g., you disclosed your user account and authentication details); or
    </li>
    <li>
        if we have a reasonable ground to suspect fraud in such actions and we
        report this to the relevant regulatory authority (in which case, the
        refund is suspended pending of the investigation of the fraud case). You
        will be liable to us for all losses which we suffer or incur relating to
        any fraud or fraudulent activity by you at any time.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>16.</strong>
    <strong>
        NON-EXECUTION OR FAULTY EXECUTION OF PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    We, as Agent of your payment service provider, are responsible for the
    proper execution of Payment Transactions, provided that all Payment
    Transaction details provided by you are correct, properly submitted and
    there is no ground to reject the execution of the Payment instructions.
    Accordingly, we may be liable to you under applicable laws where we fail to
    perform or incorrectly perform any Payment Transaction that you authorised
    us to perform.
</p>
<p>
    Where you believe we may have failed to perform or incorrectly performed
    such a Payment Transaction, you should let us know immediately via the
    contact details set out at clause 30 below and, if you request, we will make
    immediate efforts to investigate the matter and let you know the outcome of
    our investigation.
</p>
<p>
    Subject to the paragraphs below, where we have failed to perform or
    incorrectly performed such a Payment Transaction, we will without undue
    delay make good and correct the error and deliver the amount of the
    unperformed or incorrectly performed Payment Transaction as originally
    instructed. You will not be charged for such corrected Payment Transaction.
</p>
<p>
    You will not be entitled to the remedy mentioned above:
</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>
        if you do not inform us by notice in writing without undue delay (and in
        any event not later than 13 months after the date on which the incorrect
        Payment Transaction was performed) on you becoming aware of our failure
        to perform a Payment Transaction authorised by you or incorrect
        performance by us of a Payment Transaction authorised by you; or
    </li>
    <li>
        where we are able to show that the authorised amount was received at the
        appropriate time by the Recipient; or
    </li>
    <li>
        if the failure to perform or the incorrect performance was due to you
        providing us with incomplete or incorrect information or was otherwise
        due to your fault.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    We will have no liability to you for failure to execute, or any incorrect
    execution of, a Payment Transaction where the reason was our refusal to
    proceed with that Payment Transaction or any part of it or if the Payment
    Transaction was incorrectly performed due to your fault (e.g., by providing
    incorrect payment or Recipient data).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>17.</strong> <strong>FEES</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The use of our Services will incur a customer transaction fee (which will be
    charged by adding the fee to the amount on the Payment instruction) and any
    other costs as provided in these Terms &amp; Conditions. In accordance with
    applicable laws and regulations, and before execution of a Payment
    instruction, we shall provide information to you regarding the fee and any
    applicable exchange rates, which will be displayed in the order preview
    section of the App. If you do not accept the fees or exchange rates applied,
    you shall have a right to revoke the Payment instruction order until such
    time as the Payment instruction is received by the Recipient.
</p>
<p>
    In addition to any fees charged by us, a Payment Transaction may be subject
    to other fees and costs and exchange rates payable to other parties, for
    example, other payment institutions involved in the Payment Transaction, as
    well as deductions that may apply (for example for tax reasons) as required
    by the authorities of the destination country of the Payment Transaction.
    The amount that we deduct will be no more than the amount of our legal
    responsibility.
</p>
<p>
    If you use your mobile phone in connection with a Payment Transaction, you
    will also be responsible for any fees that your phone service provider may
    charge, such as fees for SMS, data services, and any other fees that your
    phone service provider may charge.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>18.</strong> <strong>SET OFF</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    You agree that we may set off any amount you owe us against any sums owed by
    us to you.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>19.</strong> <strong>PAYMENT TRANSACTION RESTRICTIONS</strong>

    Transaction where in our opinion this is necessary to comply with applicable

</p>
<p>
    Notwithstanding any prior agreement to initiate a Payment Transaction and
    subject to applicable laws and regulations, we may, in our sole discretion,
    also refuse to proceed with a Payment Transaction in circumstances which
    include (but are not limited to) where:
</p>
<p>
    (i)             the intended Recipient is anyone other than a natural
    person;
</p>
<p>
    (ii)            we are required to do so under applicable anti-money
    laundering or terrorist financing legislation and/or where we know or
    suspect the Payment Transaction may be unlawful (including for instances of
    fraud);
</p>
<p>
    (iii)           you have failed to provide us with sufficient, satisfactory,
    and reliable evidence of your identity or any other information we require

</p>
<p>
    We reserve the right not to accept or allow payments from or to, either
    directly or indirectly, certain countries which we have determined, acting
    in our sole discretion, are high risk to our business or involve a higher
    level of complexity for us in carrying out our anti-money laundering or
    anti-terrorist financing legislation transaction monitoring process.
</p>
<p>
    We further reserve the right to request, in our sole discretion, additional
    information from you, including information about the Recipient, where
    payments are to be made to certain countries and other information required
    in connection with our assessment of risk levels.
</p>
<p>
    If we refuse to proceed with the execution of a Payment instruction in
    accordance with these Terms &amp; Conditions, we will tell you prior to the
    end of the Business Day following receipt of the Payment instruction. Where
    it is possible and lawful for us to do so, we will provide the reasons for
    our refusal to proceed with your Payment instruction. In cases where you
    have provided incorrect information or omitted to provide information, we
    will explain how to rectify the situation.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>

        where you do not provide us with all the details, we require to perform
        a Payment Transaction;

        jurisdiction or by any governmental or regulatory body which authorises
        us to perform our Services;
    </li>
    <li>
        following a material breach by you of any of these Terms &amp;
        Conditions, or in the event that we discover or have reasonable cause to
        suspect any crime, fraud, fraudulent activity or money laundering by
        you;
    </li>
    <li>
        in the event that you die, become of unsound mind, become unable to pay
        your debts as and when they fall due, a petition in bankruptcy is
        presented against you, you are declared bankrupt, you become insolvent,
        you enter into an individual voluntary arrangement or go into

    <li>
        as provided for in clause 23 (Changes Beyond our Control).
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>21.</strong><strong>ACCEPTABLE PURPOSE</strong> <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to impose ‘acceptable purpose’
    terms in relation to the provision of our Services, including the
    prohibition of certain categories of Payment instructions.
</p>
<p>
    We will report any suspicious activity to the relevant regulating
    authorities.
</p>
<p>
    If any Payment Transaction is conducted or attempted to be conducted in
    breach of the acceptable purpose prohibitions applicable from time to time,
    we reserve the right to reverse the Payment Transaction, and/or close or
    suspend your use of our Services and/or report the transaction to the
    relevant law enforcement agency and/or claim damages from you.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>22.</strong>
    <strong>
        RIGHT TO RESCIND OR CANCEL A PAYMENT TRANSACTION
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Where you have authorised us to perform a Payment Transaction, we will
    execute that Payment Transaction unless:
</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>
        you provide us with clear instructions that you wish to rescind the
        Payment instruction by contacting our customer service team whose
        details are specified in clause 30 below and, in all cases;
    </li>
    <li>
        we agree in writing with you that we will not do so.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    (together a “<strong>Cancellation</strong>”)
</p>
<p>
    For the avoidance of doubt, we will not accept any Cancellation if:
</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>
        the Payment instruction has already been paid out to your Recipient;
    </li>
    <li>
        your instructions are unclear; or
    </li>
    <li>
        if any Cancellation instruction is received by us after 5.00pm on the
        last Business Day before the day that Payment Transaction is due to take
        place.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Notwithstanding the above, if you provide us with clear Cancellation
    instructions, other than in the circumstances described above where we will
    not accept a Cancellation, we will attempt (to the extent possible at that
    time) to cancel the Payment Transaction prior to the Payment Transaction
    being paid out to the Recipient. We will not, however, be liable for any
    losses incurred in connection with the Cancellation or if the Cancelation
    cannot be performed (e.g., in the event it has been executed and the funds
    have been received by the Recipient) and we reserve the right to charge you
    a fee to cover our reasonable costs for a Cancellation.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>23.</strong> <strong>CHANGES BEYOND OUR CONTROL</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We do not assume any liability if we are unable to perform any of our
    obligations to you or our performance of any of our obligations is delayed
    due to any circumstances outside of our reasonable control, including
    (without limitation) any case of force majeure, compliance with any statute,
    statutory provision, law, governmental or court order, the actions or
    instructions of the police or of any governmental or regulatory body which
    authorises us to perform our Services, cut or failure of power, failure of
    equipment, systems or software or internet interconnectivity or the
    occurrence of any extraordinary fluctuation in any financial market that may
    materially adversely affect our ability to perform our Services. If any of
    these circumstances occur in the course of executing a Payment Transaction,
    then these Terms &amp; Conditions that were applicable at the moment the
    Payment instruction was placed, shall be suspended for the period during
    which the circumstances continue or, at our discretion and in order to
    protect both you and us, we may terminate these Terms &amp; Conditions.
</p>

</p>
<p>
    This Beta Test Agreement (the “<strong>Agreement</strong>”) is effective
    from May 30, 2024, between <strong>NBK DIASPO BV</strong> (the “
    <strong>
        NBK
    </strong>
    ”) and you, ………………………………………… (the “<strong>Tester</strong>”), in which the
    Tester undertakes to test the new <strong>DIASPO software</strong> (the
    “<strong>Software</strong>”), and NBK is informed of the test results.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>1.</strong> <strong>NBK Obligations</strong>
</p>
<p>
    NBK undertakes to provide the Tester with a copy of the software and all the
    necessary documentation and explain to the Tester how to use it and the
    desired test data to be obtained. NBK hereby grants to Tester a
    non-exclusive, limited license to install the software on its devices for
    the purpose of testing the performance of the software and to inform NBK of
    the results of such testing. Once testing has been satisfactorily completed,
    NBK will grant the Tester free access to the production version (final
    version) of the software, subject to NBK's decision to proceed with
    production of the software. The Tester will be entitled to the same benefits
    to which regular users of the software are entitled.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>2.</strong> <strong>Tester Obligations</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The Tester must test the Software under normal and expected operating
    conditions in the Tester's environment during the testing period. The Tester
    must collect and report test data as mutually agreed with NBK. The Tester
    understands that NBK will have access to the software at all times and will
    perform inspections, modifications and maintenance on it at any time.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>3.</strong>
    <strong>
        Non-disclosure of Confidential Information and Trade Secrets
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The Tester acknowledges that the Software is the property and a valuable
    trade secret of NBK and is entrusted to Tester only for the purposes set
    forth in this Agreement. The Tester must treat the software with the
    strictest confidentiality. The Tester hereby expressly states and agrees not
    to disclose, use or profit, directly or indirectly, from NBK Confidential
    Information. This clause and its stipulations mentioned below will remain in
    force even after the end of the testing period.

    used in this Agreement, means all information and materials, of whatever
    nature and in whatever form, whether electronic or hard copy, relating to

    by NBK. Confidential Information includes, but is not limited to, all
    notices and other information regarding NBK and the beta test, your
    selection as a Tester, the DIASPO application (including, but not limited
    to, the information and ideas regarding the DIASPO application, software,
    software code, designs, graphics, rules, illustrations, visual
    representations, plot, theme, settings, descriptions, skills, emails,

    marketing and/or promotional elements), business and/or commercial secrets,
    test protocols, processes and standards relating to the Software and/or
    products or services NBK correspondents.

    written consent of a duly authorized representative of NBK. In particular,
    the Tester
    <strong>

        magazine, on the Internet, in a paper newspaper or otherwise) nor
        evaluate, make a report, a video of the Software or an online blog, on a
        forum or online chat.
    </strong>
    Unless expressly authorized by NBK, the Tester further agrees not to use
    Confidential Information for any other purpose whatsoever, nor to ever
    disclose it to a third party, other than NBK employees, directly or
    indirectly. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Tester agrees
    that any reports or announcements regarding Confidential Information which
    are not made or authorized by NBK and which appear prior to the official

    Tester of its obligations hereunder with respect to such Confidential
    Information.

    obligation on the part of NBK to disclose any Confidential Information to
    the Tester. NBK reserves the right to suspend, restrict or cancel the beta
    test and/or terminate the Tester's participation at its sole discretion.

</p>
<p>
    The Tester understands and acknowledges that the Software is provided for
    the Tester's own use, for testing purposes only. Nothing contained in this

    or expectation of any kind, express or implied, under any NBK Software or
    trade secret. The Tester may not sell or transfer any part of the Software
    to any third party or use the Software in any way to produce, market or
