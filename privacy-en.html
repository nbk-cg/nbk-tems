        the right to object I certain circumstances (see the section headed “Your

    </p>
    <p>
        For the delivery of direct marketing to you via e-mail, we’ll need your
        explicit consent; that is, you need take a positive and affirmative action
        when consenting by, for example checking a tick box that we’ll provide.
    </p>
    <p>
        If, at any time, you are not satisfied with our approach to marketing, you
        have the right to withdraw consent. To find out how to withdraw your
        consent, see the section headed “Your rights” below.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you register with us and set up an account to use our services, the

    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Who we share your Data with</strong>
    </p>

        We may share your Data with the following groups of people in certain
        situations:
    </p>
    <p>
        a.      Our employees, agents and/or professional advisors-
    </p>
    <p>
        b.     Any of our group companies, affiliates, subsidiaries joint venture
        partners, business partners  or any companies that we control- in this case
        we will require them to honour this Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <p>
        c.      Third-party service providers who provide services to us which
        require the processing of personal data- These services may include payment
        processing, data analysis, e-mail delivery, hosting services, customer
        service and marketing assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
        d.     Other third-parties (advertisers and investors)- for the purpose of
        conducting general business analysis. We also share your information with
        such third-parties for marketing purposes, as permitted by law.
    </p>
    <p>
        e.      Relevant authorities- as permitted by law and where it is necessary
        to respond to a legal process, to investigate or remedy potential violations
        of our policies, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of others.
        This includes exchanging information with other entities for fraud

    <p>
        f.      Sale or bankruptcy- if we reorganise or sell all or a portion of our
        assets, undergo a merger, or are acquired by another entity, we may share
        your information to the successor entity. If we go out of business or enter
        bankruptcy, your information would be an asset transferred or acquired by a
        third-party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur and that the
        transferee may decline to honour commitments we made in this Privacy Policy.
        However we will, to the best of our ability, take the necessary steps with
        the aim of ensuring that your privacy is protected.
    </p>
    <p>
        We are not responsible for the actions of third-parties with whom you share
        personal or sensitive date, and we have no authority to manage or control
        third-party solicitations. If you no longer wish to receive correspondence,
        e-mails or other communications from third-parties, you are responsible for
        contacting the third-party directly.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Keeping Data secure</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        We will use technical, physical and organisational measures to safeguard
        your Data, for example:
    </p>
    <p>
        a.      Access to your account is controlled by a username, a password
        and/or a One-Time Password (OTP) that is unique to you.
    </p>
    <p>
        b.     We store your Data on secure servers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Technical and organisational measures include measures to deal with any
        suspected data breach. While we have taken reasonable steps to secure your
        Data, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are
        perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be
        guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse. Therefore, we
        cannot guarantee complete security if you provide us with your personal
        information. Any information disclosed online is vulnerable to interception
        and misuse by unauthorised parties. If you suspect any misuse, loss or
        unauthorised access to your Data, please let us know immediately by
        contacting us via this e-mail address:
        <a href="mailto:customers@nbk-cg.com" class="link">

        </a>
        .
    </p>
    <p>

        only hold your Data on our systems for the period necessary to fulfil the
        purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy or until you request that the Data
        be deleted.
    </p>
    <p>
        Even if we deleted your Data, it may persist on backup or archival media for
        legal, tax or regulatory purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Your Rights</strong>
    </p>
    <p>

        hold about you, we will not charge you for this, unless your request is
        “manifestly unfounded or excessive”. Where we are legally permitted to do
        so, we may refuse your request. If we refuse your request, we will inform
        you of the reasons why.

        “block” us from using your Data or limit the way in which we can use it.
    </p>

        e. <strong>Right to data portability</strong>- the right to request that we
        move, copy or transfer your Data.
    </p>
    <p>

        Data including where we use it for our legitimate interests.
    </p>
    <p>

        <strong>Links to other websites</strong>
    </p>

        The App may, from time to time, provide links to other websites and
        application of interest, including advertisements and external services,
        that are not affiliated with us. We have no control over such websites and
        applications. We are not responsible for the content, privacy and security
        practices and policies of any third-parties websites or applications. This
        Privacy Policy does not extend to your use of such websites and
        applications, and therefore we cannot guarantee the safety and privacy of
        your information. You are advised to read the Privacy Policy or statement of
        these websites and applications before using them and you should take those
        steps necessary to, in your discretion, protect the privacy of your

        You may not transfer any of your rights under this Privacy Policy to any
        other person. We may transfer our rights under this Privacy Policy where we
        reasonably believe your rights will not be affected.
    </p>
    <p>
        If any court or competent authority finds that any provision of this Privacy
        Policy (or part of any provision) is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that
        provision or part-provision will, to the extent required, be deemed to be
        deleted, and the validity and enforceability of the other provisions of this
        Privacy Policy will not be affected.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unless agree, no delay, act or omission by a third-party in exercising any
        right or remedy will be deemed a waiver of that, or any other right or
        remedy.
